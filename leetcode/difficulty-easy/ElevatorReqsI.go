// Question :

// You are given an integer n denoting the number of floors in a building, where the floors are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
// You are also given an integer array requests, where requests represents the sequence of floor requests.
// An elevator starts at floor 0 and follows these rules:
// The elevator moves one floor per second.
// The elevator serves requests in the given order.
// If the elevator is already on the requested floor, no movement is needed.
// After serving a request, the elevator immediately starts moving toward the next request.
// Return the total time in seconds required to serve all requests.
// Example 1:
// Input: n = 5, requests = [2,1,4,3]
// Output: 7
// Explanation:
// requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds.
// requests[1] = 1: Moving from floor 2 to floor 1 takes 1 second.
// requests[2] = 4: Moving from floor 1 to floor 4 takes 3 seconds.
// requests[3] = 3: Moving from floor 4 to floor 3 takes 1 second.
// The total time required is 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7 seconds.
// Example 2:
// Input: n = 3, requests = [2,0,0]
// Output: 4
// Explanation:
// requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds.
// requests[1] = 0: Moving from floor 2 to floor 0 takes 2 seconds.
// requests[2] = 0: No movement is needed.
// The total time required is 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 seconds.
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 100
// 1 <= requests.length <= 100
// 0 <= requests[i] <= n - 1

// Answer :

func ElevatorReqsI(n int, requests []int) (r int) {
	n = 0
	for i := 0; i < len(requests); i++ {
		r += abs6(requests[i] - n)
		n = requests[i]
	}
	return
}

func abs6(n int) int {
	if n < 0 {
		return -n
	}
	return n
}
