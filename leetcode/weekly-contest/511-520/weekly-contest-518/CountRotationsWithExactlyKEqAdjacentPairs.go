// Question :

// You are given a string s of length n and an integer k.
// A cyclic rotation of s is obtained by choosing a prefix of s whose length is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), and moving it to the end of the string while preserving the order of all characters.
// For every cyclic rotation of s, let its score be the number of indices i such that 0 <= i < n - 1 and the characters at positions i and i + 1 are equal.
// Return the number of cyclic rotations of s whose score equals k.
// A prefix of a string is a substring that starts from the beginning of the string and extends to any point within it.
// A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, which may be empty.
//
// Example 1:
// Input: s = "aab", k = 1
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// The cyclic rotations of s are:
// "aab": The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so score = 1.
// "aba": No two adjacent characters are equal, so score = 0.
// "baa": The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so score = 1.
// Since score equals k for 2 cyclic rotations of s, the answer is 2.
// Example 2:
// Input: s = "abca", k = 0
// Output: 1
// Explanation:
// The cyclic rotations of s are:
// "abca": No two adjacent characters are equal, so score = 0.
// "bcaa": The characters at positions 2 and 3 are equal, so score = 1.
// "caab": The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so score = 1.
// "aabc": The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so score = 1.
// Since score equals k for only 1 cyclic rotation of s, the answer is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n == s.length <= 100
// s only consists of lowercase English letters.
// 0 <= k <= n - 1

// Answer :

func CountRotationsWithExactlyKEqAdjacentPairs(s string, k int) (r int) {
	for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
		newS, c := s[i:]+s[:i], 0
		for j := 0; j < len(newS)-1; j++ {
			if newS[j] == newS[j+1] {
				c++
			}
		}
		if c == k {
			r++
		}
	}
	return
}
