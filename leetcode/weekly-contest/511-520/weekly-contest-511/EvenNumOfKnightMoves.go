// Question :

// You are given two integer arrays start and target, where each array is of the form [x, y] representing a cell on a standard 8 x 8 chessboard.
// Return true if a knight can move from start to target in an even number of moves. Otherwise, return false.
// Note: A valid knight move consists of moving two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to it. The figure below illustrates all eight possible moves from a cell.
//
// Example 1:
// Input: start = [1,1], target = [2,2]
// Output: true
// Explanation:
// One possible sequence of moves is (1, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (2, 2).
// The knight reaches the target in 4 moves, which is even. Thus, the answer is true.
// Example 2:
// Input: start = [4,5], target = [6,6]
// Output: false
// Explanation:​​​​​​​
// It is impossible to reach target = [6, 6] from start = [4, 5] in an even number of moves. Thus, the answer is false.
//
// Constraints:
// start.length == target.length == 2
// 0 <= start[i], target[i] <= 7

// Answer :

func EvenNumOfKnightMoves(start []int, target []int) bool {
	x, y := start[0]+start[1], target[0]+target[1]
	xB, yB := x%2 == 0, y%2 == 0
	return xB == yB
}
